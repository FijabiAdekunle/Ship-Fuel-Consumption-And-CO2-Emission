# Ship-Fuel-Consumption-And-CO2-Emission
**Analysis of Fuel Consumption & CO2 Emissions of 4 ship types on Nigerian water ways**

## Project Overview
This project explores the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of different types of ships operating in Nigerian waterways. It leverages a generated dataset and analytical methods to derive actionable insights into the fuel usage patterns and environmental impact of various ship types.
The dataset includes realistic details about ship fuel types, consumption rates  and CO2 emissions, designed to reflect the operational scenarios on Nigerian waterways. The project aims to provide valuable insights for marine operations optimization and environmental sustainability.
